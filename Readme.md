# DebateTab2

A reboot of the DebateTab project

This project contains the client and server code. It's based on express ejs boilerplate

## Conceptual Integrity
Goals for this implementation:

* Modularize everything in order to minimize the amount of code in each file. This is a rule of thumb, but it makes editing much simpler.

## Tabulation

Big front end project that can operate without connectivity. Uses backbone as a framework.

### Workflow
Google Closure is used as a build system.

## Registration

This is coming later.
